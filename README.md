Hlípa is an isometric computer game for 8-bit computers PMD-85 and Sharp MZ-800,
with 16-bit Atari ST port, too. In the game, the player has to find
and destroy six enemies in the shape of crowns.
The game was designed and developed by Karel Šuhajda.

A source file for a preliminary game world map is available (<a
href=http://pmd85.borik.net/wiki/Hl%C3%ADpa>pmd85.borik.net/wiki/Hlípa</a>, see
link labeled "zdrojový kód" mapy), using special language to describe the rooms of
the game. The preliminary map contains only three of the six crowns present in the
final version.
