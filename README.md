This project contains two parts, both related to the game Hlípa:

* [hlmScriptView](hlmScriptView.htm) - Hlipa map source code viewer,
* [Hlipaguide](Hlipaguide.htm) - a graphical guide for completing Hlipa.

HlmScriptView part of the project started when I discovered a preliminary version
of Hlipa game world map source file available online. A web application was
created as a tool for viewing room definitions contained in the Hlípa map source
file.

The preliminary game map source file is available at
[pmd85.borik.net/wiki/Hlípa](http://pmd85.borik.net/wiki/Hlípa) (see
link labeled "zdrojový kód" mapy), using special language to describe the rooms of
the game. The preliminary map contains only three of the six crowns present in the
final version.

The other part of the project, Hlípa guide, is a graphical depiction of all the
rooms that should be visited to complete the game. It relates to the full game, not
the preliminary map, so it contains all six crowns.

**About Hlípa**

Hlípa is an isometric computer game for 8-bit computers PMD-85 and Sharp MZ-800,
with 16-bit Atari ST port, too. In the game, the player has to find
and destroy six enemies in the shape of crowns.
The game was designed and developed by Karel Šuhajda.
